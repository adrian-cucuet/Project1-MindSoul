    <h2>How stress affects the body?</h2>
    <p>Stress can become a problem when it starts to affect how you cope with day-to-day stuff.</p>
    <p>The human body responds to events that provoke stress by activating the nervous system and specific hormones.</p>
    <p>These hormones speed up heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, and metabolism. The physical changes prepare you to react quickly to handle the pressure of the moment.</p>
    <p>This natural reaction is known as the stress response. This response improves your ability to perform well under pressure.</p>
    <h2>Managing stress</h2>
    <p>It's not usually possible to completely remove the stress from your life. But, managing it is definitely possible and lets you get on with things. Here are some ideas for managing stress for you to try:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Go for a walk or run</h3>
        <p>Exercise can be a really good way of relieving stress. It helps to get rid of all that pent up energy and can leave you feeling much calmer. Any sort of exercise can be good.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Hang out with friends</h3>
        <p>You might need to take your mind off things for a while. Hanging out with friends is one way of doing that. You might find that similar things stress you all out. Talking about your problems with them may be helpful.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Take some deep breaths</h3>
        <p>Deep breathing can help to relax the body and calm you down. Taking deep breaths can help you to focus on what you are about to do. You should try deep breathing before an exam, game, job interview or before going on stage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Set realistic goals</h3>
        <p>Becoming over-stressed may make it harder to keep things in perspective. Setting realistic goals can be a really useful way of managing stress.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Have multiple options to achieve your goals</h3>
        <p>There's never just one way to achieve something. It's important not to put all your eggs in one basket. Investigate and plan other ways to get to where you want to go. This could be working towards a college degree, job, or holiday.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Try to avoid smoking, alcohol and caffeine</h3>
        <p>It may be tempting to use smoking and alcohol as a means of managing your stress. Try to avoid using these things as a way of coping. In the long run, they could make you more stressed out.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Watch what you're thinking</h3>
        <p>Your outlook, attitude, and thoughts influence the way you see things. Is your cup half full or half empty? A healthy dose of optimism can help you make the best out of stressful circumstances. Even if you tend to be a bit of a pessimist, everyone can learn to think more optimistically and reap the benefits.</p>
