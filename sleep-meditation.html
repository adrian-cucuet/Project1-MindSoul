    <h2>Sleep is important for your mental health!</h2>
    <p>Most people need between 5 to 9 hours sleep a night. The ideal amount is 8 hours, but everyone's different.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it's not always possible to get as much sleep as you would like. If you don't sleep well, you won't feel as alert as you should. You will feel easily agitated and your actions may seem slow.</p>
    <p>Stress and anxiety can lead to sleeping problems. You can experience stress or anxiety at work, with family, or in daily life. As the stressful situation passes, a more regular sleep pattern should return.</p>
    <p>Try not to worry if your sleep is disturbed for a short while. This can be perfectly normal.</p>
    <h2>Better sleeping tips</h2>
    <p>You can take steps to improve your sleep. They include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Keep active</h3>
        <p>Regular exercise can help improve your sleep. But try to avoid exercise in the hour before bedtime.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Avoid stimulants</h3>
        <p>Avoid tea and coffee, or foods high in sugar, in the evenings.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Routine</h3>
        <p>Go to bed at the same time each night and get up at the same time each morning. This helps your body clock get into a rhythm and makes sleeping feel more natural.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Naps</h3>
        <p>If possible, avoid naps during the day. This is because it makes it harder to fall asleep at night.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Relax</h3>
        <p>Process the day's thoughts and feelings and then let go of them. If it helps, write things down or talk about them with someone you trust. Reading in bed can focus your mind and empty it of the day's worries.</p>
