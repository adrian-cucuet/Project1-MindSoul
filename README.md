# [Mind & Soul](https://adrian-cucuet.github.io/project1/index.html)
 
Mind & Soul is a website that creates a safe space for people who suffer from anxiety and stress. You can find information on how stress can affect you in your personal life, work life and it can even affect your sleep. Throughout the website you will find useful information on how to deal and cope with stress and anxiety at home or at work. Guided meditation videos will help you relax and prepare you for anything that might come towards you during the day.
 
If you have problems sleeping we have a page with advice on how to get a better sleep, as well as guided meditations to help you achieve an amazing sleep.

## Features
 
### Existing Features
 
- __Navigation Bar__
 
 - Featured on all pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Meditation section and Contact section and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
 - On small screens like mobile phones, the navigation is shown at the bottom of the screen. The decision was based on the latest UX research.

- __Meditation pages__
 
 - There are 3 meditation pages using the same structure: Stress, Work and Sleep.
 - Each meditation page consists of vital information on how the body and life is affected by stress and anxiety, as well and tips on how to handle daily stress and relax.
 - Each page is offering information on how to start meditation and 3 guided meditation videos.
 
### Features Left to Implement
 
- Another feature idea would be to create a Retreats page where the users can organize retreat events and register to participate.
- Implementing animation using JavaScript for the illustration and the mobile navbar.
 
## Testing
 
Testing has been done on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and the website was performing well on all three.
 
The mobile responsiveness testing has been done using iPhone, Xiaomi and Samsung and the website kept the same layout on all three with no issues.

Due to the Favicon files uploaded, the website has a .webmanifest file that allows the mobile website to be saved on the home screen of the phone and acts like a progresive web app.

### Unfixed Bugs
 
Due to videos embedded in the Mediation pages, the performance was low. I have tried to find solutions to increase the performance score. One of the solutions was to create a link for the videos and send the user on the YouTube website. As this would drive traffic away from this website I decided to wait until I find a javascript solution to fix the loading time for the pages.
 
## Deployment
 
- The site was deployed to GitHub pages and was created using GitPod.
