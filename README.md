# [Mind & Soul](https://adrian-cucuet.github.io/project1/index.html)
 
Mind & Soul is a website that creates a safe space for people who suffer from anxiety and stress. You can find information on how stress can affect you in your personal life, work life and it can even affect your sleep. Throughout the website, you will find useful information on how to deal with and cope with stress and anxiety at home or work. Guided meditation videos will help you relax and prepare you for anything that might come towards you during the day.
 
If you have problems sleeping we have a page with advice on how to get better sleep, as well as guided meditations to help you achieve an amazing sleep.

## Features
 
### Navigation Bar
 
 - Featured on all pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Meditation section, and Contact section and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation.
 - On small screens like mobile phones, the navigation is shown at the bottom of the screen. The decision was based on the latest UX research.

### Meditation pages
 
 - There are 3 meditation pages, using the same structure:

![Meditation Page Structure](https://github.com/adrian-cucuet/project1/blob/main/assets/images/meditation-example.gif)

 - Each meditation page consists of vital information on how the body and life are affected by stress and anxiety, as well as tips on how to handle daily stress and relax.
 - Each page is offering information on how to start meditation and 3 guided meditation videos.

### Thank you page

## User Experience (UX)

### User stories

As a first-time user:

- I want to understand what meditation is.
- I want to know what are the benefits of meditation.
- I want to find specific meditations for my problems.
- I want to learn how to meditate.

As a returning user:

- I want to use meditation techniques.
- I want to connect with other people facing the same problems. (Social Media Links)

### Wireframes
 
For the wireframes, I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). From left to right we have Home Page Desktop and Meditation Desktop Page, Home Page Tablet and Meditation Tablet Page, and Home Page Mobile and Meditation Mobile Page.

### Color Scheme

For the color scheme, I picked simple colors, using the 60-30-10 rule. The colors are consistent throughout the website, creating a relaxed environment for the user.

### Features Left to Implement
 
- Another feature idea would be to create a Retreats page where the users can organize retreat events and register to participate.
- Implementing animation using JavaScript for the illustration and the mobile navbar.
 
## Testing
 
Testing has been done on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and the website was performing well on all three.
 
The mobile responsiveness testing has been done using iPhone, Xiaomi, and Samsung and the website kept the same layout on all three with no issues.

Due to the Favicon files uploaded, the website has a .webmanifest file that allows the mobile website to be saved on the home screen of the phone and acts like a progressive web app.

 
### Validator Testing
 
- HTML
 - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fadrian-cucuet.github.io%2Fproject1%2Findex.html)
- CSS
 - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fadrian-cucuet.github.io%2Fproject1%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
 
 - The results for the Lighthouse are all above 90:

### Unfixed Bugs
 
Due to videos embedded in the Mediation pages, the performance was low. I have tried to find solutions to increase the performance score. One of the solutions was to create a link for the videos and send the user on the YouTube website. As this would drive traffic away from this website I decided to wait until I find a javascript solution to fix the loading time for the pages.
 
## Deployment
 
- The following are the steps I went through to deploy my live site:

    - The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab on the top menu.
    - From the settings page, navigate to the Pages section from the left-hand side menu.
    - From the source section drop-down menu, select "Deploy From a Branch"
    - Press the save button.
    - After a few minutes, you can refresh the page to see your Live Site link at the top.
