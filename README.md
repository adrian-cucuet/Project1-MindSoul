Mind & Soul is a website that creates a safe space for people who suffer from anxiety and stress. You can find information on how stress can affect you in your personal life, work life and it can even affect your sleep. Throughout the website you will find useful information on how to deal and cope with stress and anxiety at home or at work. Guided meditation videos will help you relax and prepare you for anything that might come towards you during the day.

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing 

Testing has been done on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and the website was performing well on all three.

The mobile responsiveness testing has been done using iPhone, Xiaomi and Samsung and the website kept the same layout on all three with no issues.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

Due to videos embeded in the Mediation pages, the performance was low. I have tried to find solutions to increase the performance score. One of the solution was to create a link for the videos and send the user on YouTube website. As this would drive traffic away from this website I decided to wait until I find a javascript solution to fix the loading time for the pages.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages and was created using GitPod.
