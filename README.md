# Mind&Soul

Mind & Soul is a website that creates a safe space for people who suffer from anxiety and stress. You can find information on how stress can affect you in your personal life, work life and it can even affect your sleep. Throughout the website you will find useful information on how to deal and cope with stress and anxiety at home or at work. Guided meditation videos will help you relax and prepare you for anything that might come towards you during the day.

If you have problems sleeping we have a page with advice on how to get a better sleep, as well as guided meditations to help you achieve an amazing sleep.

- Implementing animation using JavaScript for the illustration and the mobile navbar.

## Testing 

Testing has been done on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and the website was performing well on all three.

The mobile responsiveness testing has been done using iPhone, Xiaomi and Samsung and the website kept the same layout on all three with no issues.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

Due to videos embeded in the Mediation pages, the performance was low. I have tried to find solutions to increase the performance score. One of the solution was to create a link for the videos and send the user on YouTube website. As this would drive traffic away from this website I decided to wait until I find a javascript solution to fix the loading time for the pages.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages and was created using GitPod.
